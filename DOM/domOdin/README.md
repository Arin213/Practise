# DOM Manipulation Project
NOTE: README.md was created using chatGPT
This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation using only JavaScript. The task was to dynamically create and insert HTML elements into the page using `document.createElement`, `element.style`, and `element.appendChild`, without writing them directly in the HTML.


## 💡 Features

The following elements are dynamically added to the page via JavaScript:

1. A `<p>` tag with red text saying:  
   **"Hey I’m red!"**

2. A `<h3>` tag with blue text saying:  
   **"I’m a blue h3!"**

3. A `<div>` with:
   - A black border  
   - Pink background color  
   - Inside it:
     - An `<h1>` saying: **"I’m in a div"**
     - A `<p>` saying: **"ME TOO!"**

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Copy all files (`index.html` and `script.js`) into the same folder on your computer.
2. Open `index.html` with any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. You should see the dynamic content added to the page via JavaScript.
